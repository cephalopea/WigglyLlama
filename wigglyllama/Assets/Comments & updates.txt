##### Rules of use: Below is a comment/update feed to explain what you have done during a work session. Remember to 
date, sign, time stamp, and mark the biggining of your posts and place them ABOVE others in cronological order, but 
below the orginization posts (see earlyist two posts as examples). Below posts should not be questions, only progress
reports.

#### Organization Posts: Currently all work should take place within your personallized scene unless you are collaborating
in real time with someone on their scene. Looking at other peoples scenes will be helpful just make sure not to save over any work if you are outside
your scene. A final game scene will be compiled as soon as we understand all the tools we will be using.

# Quick to do list: tweak camera movement, make credits opaque, maybe make some instructions to add to the title screen or 
run when the game starts?

# I know how to spawn in sprites and I believe I know how to spawn joints to those sprites. However I am struggling to pull
the position of an object from a seperate script. ie I have a script on an object and I use GameObject.Find to get a
different object. I reference what I set the object to in my script and try to get its transform. However this turns up
errors having found a way to fix it yet.

# So I know how to control the joints via the motor which we can set to controls. However while under control we would have to
turn the motors on because they dont freely swing when on (so turn off after we stop controlling). Which I think would
mean a small amount of input lag. Hinge joints remain the best option as far as I can tell so far. If we can find a way to
the joints externally that would solve a good deal. I have an idea for that but it might make the expanding neck more
difficult.

# I tried wheel joints. There was alot to say that made them good. Actually moving them posed an issue because during
movement they ignore gravitational pull until reset to zero which would be akward to work with.
